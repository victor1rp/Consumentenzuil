## Introduction
Many NS(Nederlandse Spoorwegen) travelers want to give their comments about NS services but nobody will listen to them. That is why we made this GUI, where travelers of the NS can send us their comments/compliments about our service. We will get a dictionary json.file of these comments where we can choose which one will we accept/reject. Then we will tweet the accepted comments and display the most recent tweets in a screen at the station hall.
